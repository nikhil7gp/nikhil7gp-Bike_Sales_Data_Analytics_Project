# 🚴 Bike Purchase Analytics Project

## 📁 Overview

This project explores customer demographic and lifestyle data to understand the factors that influence bike purchases. The analysis is performed using a cleaned dataset in Excel and focuses on identifying trends across age, income, education, commute behavior, and regional differences.

## 🧠 Objectives

* Identify which customer segments are more likely to purchase bikes
* Analyze the impact of lifestyle factors (e.g., commute distance, car ownership) on purchasing behavior
* Discover patterns in gender, marital status, and income related to bike ownership
* Provide insights to inform marketing strategies and customer targeting

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

* Removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy
* Checked for and handled missing or inconsistent values
* Created new categorical fields such as **Age Brackets** for grouped analysis
* Standardized column values for consistent filtering (e.g., "Yes"/"No", region names, commute distances)
